# 377-final-project

## Code Description
### Piping commands
The first thing that was implemented was the piping commands (|). I declared a variable to keep track of the index of the pipe operator, if it existed. If it did exist (index != -1), then I called pipe and fork and handled each process, duplicating the proper file descriptor. The child process executed the first set of commands and the parent the second. 

### Redirect STDOUT
Next, I handeled the redirection of standard output (>). Similar to pipe, I kept track of the index of the ridrection operator. If the index was not -1, meaning there was a redirection, I opened the argument file that would take in the output of the first set of commands and then exectued the command.

### Builtin commands
If there was no pipe or redirection, I checked if it was a command I needed to handle separately. I created a seperate function called cmd_handler(), which exec_command() calls, to handle functions outside of the regular Linux shell. This function handles 4 different commands: "pwd", "cd", "help", and "tim".
pwd: This bash command prints out the current working directory. I did this by using the function getcwd(), which takes in a buffer and the size of a buffer and prints out the path to the buffer. 
cd: This bash command changes the current working directory to the specified location. I did this by using the function chdir(), which changes the current working directory to the input. 
help: This bash command provides informatiobn on the shell's builtin commands. I call the function openHelp() which simply puts a string detailing the shell's functionality and what all can be done. 
tim: This command is a command I personally implemented that prints out "Tim is the best!" in cool ascii art. Just a silly command!

### Linux shell general commands
If there was no pipe, redirection, and it was not a command I needed to handle seperately, I used fork and execvp to normally execute the command using the argument given.
